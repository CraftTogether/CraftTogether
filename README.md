# Craft Together
This repo is to submit issues based on the Craft Together server. If you got any issues with the server, have suggestions, or have ideas which you would like to be implemented, create an issue on this repository. Further explanation below:

## If the issue is about a bug
The issue will be discussed and moved to the repository of the plugin (if it is an issue with a plugin) which is causing the bug, we haven't deleted it, only moved it elsewhere, so that it is respective to the repository which it effects.

## If the issue is a suggestion
We will discuss the idea on the issue, and will discuss whether or not it will be added to our todo list, the issue being closed means 1 of 2 things:
- The idea was implemented, and added to the server therefore the issue is no longer needed
- The idea was rejected (we will inform you with a closing comment if the idea was rejected)

## If the issue is general questions/support
We will discuss the questions on the issue, the issue will remain open until the issue is resolved and then will be closed. The issue will still be open for anyone else who wants to read it, for example if someone else runs into the same issue on the server.
